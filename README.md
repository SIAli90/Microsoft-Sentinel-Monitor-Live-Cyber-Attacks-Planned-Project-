# Microsoft-Sentinel-Monitor-Live-Cyber-Attacks-Planned-Project-
Designed a SIEM system with Microsoft Sentinel, covering architecture, security, and data analytics. Gained valuable experience despite not completing full deployment due to budget constraints.


Microsoft Sentinel: Monitor Live Cyber Attacks (Planned Project) 

**Project Overview**
This project involves creating a comprehensive Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Microsoft Sentinel. The steps include:

**Project Planning**

- Designed an architecture for deploying multiple honeypot VMs in Microsoft Azure.
- Conducted requirements analysis to identify security and monitoring goals.

**Security Configuration**
- Deployed VMs with disabled firewalls, exposing them to the public internet.
- Integrated Microsoft Defender for Cloud for enhanced threat detection.

**Data Collection and Analytics**

- Established a Log Analytics Workspace and implemented data ingestion pipelines.
- Developed Kusto Query Language (KQL) scripts for detailed log analysis and threat identification.

**Visualization and Monitoring**

- Created real-time dashboards in Microsoft Sentinel to visualize attack patterns.
- Configured map visualizations to display geolocation data of attack origins.

**Incident Response and Documentation**

- Configured alerts and practiced incident response.
- Secured the environment, observed the reduction of attacks, and documented all processes and outcomes.

**Documentation**
Detailed documentation of the project planning, implementation, and outcomes is provided in this repository. The goal is to observe and analyze live cyber-attacks, improve incident response, and enhance overall security posture.

**Screenshots and Diagrams**
Due to budget constraints, full deployment and live screenshots are not available. Below are sample diagrams and representations to illustrate the project's architecture and processes. Some images are sourced from publicly available materials for demonstration purposes.
