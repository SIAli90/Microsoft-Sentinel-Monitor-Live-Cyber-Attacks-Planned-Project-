Azure VM Honeypot Project
Overview:
Designed a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system using Microsoft Sentinel, focusing on architecture, security monitoring, and data analytics. The project aimed to detect and analyze real-world cyber threats using honeypot VMs in Azure, though full deployment was limited due to budget constraints.

Project Scope & Objectives
âœ… Deploy a Honeypot Environment: Designed an architecture for multiple Windows 10 VMs in Azure to attract and log malicious activity.
âœ… Implement Security Monitoring: Integrated Microsoft Sentinel & Log Analytics Workspace to collect and analyse security events.
âœ… Enhance Threat Detection: Utilised Microsoft Defender for Cloud for advanced monitoring and detection.
âœ… Develop KQL Queries for Threat Intelligence: Created Kusto Query Language (KQL) scripts to extract failed login attempts (Event ID 4625) and detect attack trends.
âœ… Visualise Attack Data: Configured Sentinel dashboards & geolocation maps to monitor live threats.
âœ… Incident Response & Mitigation: Set up alerts, automated responses, and documented findings.

Technical Implementation
ðŸ”¹ Project Planning
Designed a honeypot architecture to attract malicious login attempts.
Conducted security assessments and identified monitoring requirements.
ðŸ”¹ Security Configuration
Deployed Windows 10 VMs with intentionally exposed attack surfaces (disabled firewalls, open RDP).
Configured NSG rules to allow inbound traffic and simulate a vulnerable system.
Integrated Microsoft Defender for Cloud for threat detection.
ðŸ”¹ Data Collection & Analytics
Created a Log Analytics Workspace (LAW) to collect security logs.
Ingested Windows Security Event logs (Event ID 4625 â€“ Failed Logins).
Developed KQL queries to analyse attack trends and correlate attacker IPs.
ðŸ”¹ Threat Visualisation & Monitoring
Built Microsoft Sentinel dashboards to track attack patterns.
Configured a real-time attack map using Sentinel Watchlists & GeoIP data.
ðŸ”¹ Incident Response & Mitigation
Implemented Sentinel alerts for failed brute-force attempts.
Documented findings on attack behaviour, logging IP sources, timestamps, and attack frequency.
Secured the environment and observed changes in attack rates.

Project Outcomes
âœ… Demonstrated the use of Microsoft Sentinel for real-time security monitoring.
âœ… Developed hands-on experience in log analysis and SIEM security operations.
âœ… Gained insights into cyber-attack behaviours and attacker geolocation tracking.
âœ… Successfully configured a honeypot environment to attract and log attacks.
